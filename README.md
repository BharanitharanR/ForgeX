# 🚀 **ForgeX Integrator**

The **Integrator Module** is responsible for orchestrating the **Dockerized microservices** of the ForgeX platform, along with essential dependencies like **MongoDB** and **RabbitMQ**. It uses **Docker Compose** to dynamically detect and run all service images generated by the previous modules:
- `Ingestor`
- `Assimilator`
- `Runtime`

---

## ⚙️ **Features**
- 🔹 **Dynamic Docker Image Discovery:** Automatically detects and includes Docker images generated by the previous modules.
- 🔹 **Service Orchestration:** Uses Docker Compose to run the microservices together in a shared network.
- 🔹 **Dependency Management:** Includes **MongoDB** and **RabbitMQ** services in the same network.
- 🔹 **Scalability:** Easily add more services by modifying the `services.list` file.

## 🚀 **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

- 🐳 **Docker** (version `>= 20.10`)
- 🛠️ **Docker Compose** (version `>= 1.29`)
- 🐘 **Java** (version `>= 21`)
- 📦 **Maven** (version `>= 3.8`)

---

## 🔥 **Build and Run**

### ✅ **1️⃣ Build the Entire Project**

Run the following command at the **root level** of the ForgeX project to build all the services and generate Docker images:
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Register Docker Images
During the Maven build, the image names from the previous modules (Ingestor, Assimilator, Runtime) will be automatically added to the services.list file.

Example services.list:
```yaml

services:
ingestor:
image: forgex/ingestor:1.0.0
ports:
- "8081:8081"
networks:
- forgeX-network

assimilator:
image: forgex/assimilator:1.0.0
ports:
- "8082:8082"
networks:
- forgeX-network

runtime:
image: forgex/runtime:1.0.0
ports:
- "8083:8083"
networks:
- forgeX-network
```

## Start the Entire Platform
To run all services along with MongoDB and RabbitMQ, navigate to the integration module and run:
```bash
cd integration
docker-compose up --build
```
