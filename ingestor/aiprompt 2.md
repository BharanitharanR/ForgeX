        - "name": field name
        - "type": one of string, number, date, boolean
        - "required": true or false

2. "edges" - a list of relationships between entities, each with:
    - "source": the entity that owns or references the other
    - "target": the related entity
    - "relationship": the relationship name, e.g., "belongsTo", "linkedTo", "contains"

3. Optional "businessRules" and "events" sections may be included if relevant.

Please generate a complete and valid JSON payloa[aiprompt.md](aiprompt.md)d for the ingestor service.
